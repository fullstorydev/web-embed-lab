# Web Embed Lab

The Web Embed Lab (WEL) provides tools for testing that a specific version of an embedded script does not negatively effect the web page in which it is embedded. Many web sites embed dozens of third party scripts and as a result are often slow to download and slow to render.

See [the main README](https://github.com/fullstorydev/web-embed-lab#readme) for documentation.
